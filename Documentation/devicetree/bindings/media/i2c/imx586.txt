* Sony 1/2.0-Inch 8Mpixel CMOS Digital Image Sensor

The Sony imx586 is a 1/2.0-inch CMOS active pixel digital image sensor with
an active array size of 8000H x 6000V. It is programmable through I2C
interface. The I2C addresses are fixed to 0x34 & 0x20.
Image data is sent through MIPI CSI-2, which is configured as either 1 (?),
2, 3 or 4 data lanes.

Required Properties:
- compatible: value should be "sony,imx586" for imx586 sensor
- reg: I2C bus address of the device
- reg2: Second I2C bus address of the device
- clocks: reference to the xclk input clock.
- clock-names: should be "xclk".
- DOVDD-supply: Digital I/O voltage supply, 1.8 volts
- AVDD1-supply: Analog voltage supply, 2.8 volts
- AVDD2-supply: Analog voltage supply, 1.8 volts
- DVDD-supply: Digital core voltage supply, 1.1 volts

Optional Properties:
- xclr-gpios: reference to the GPIO connected to the xclr pin, if any. Must be
	      released after all supplies are applied.
	      This is an active high signal to the imx586.

The imx586 device node should contain one 'port' child node with
an 'endpoint' subnode. For further reading on port node refer to
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

Endpoint node required properties for CSI-2 connection are:
- remote-endpoint: a phandle to the bus receiver's endpoint node.
- clock-lanes: should be set to <0> (clock lane on hardware lane 0)
- data-lanes: should be set to <1> (?), <1 2>, <1 2 3> or <1 2 3 4>

Example:
	sensor@10 {
		compatible = "sony,imx586";
		reg = <0x34>;
		reg2 = <0x20>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		clocks = <&imx586_clk>;
		clock-names = "xclk";
		xclr-gpios = <&gpio_sensor 0 0>;
		DOVDD-supply = <&vgen4_reg>; /* 1.8v */
		AVDD1-supply = <&vgen3_reg>;  /* 2.8v */
		AVDD2-supply = <&vgen4_reg>;  /* 1.8v */
		DVDD-supply = <&vgen2_reg>;  /* 1.1v !!! */

		imx586_clk: camera-clk {
			compatible = "fixed-clock";
			#clock-cells = <0>;
			clock-frequency = <24000000>; /* ??? */
		};

		port {
			sensor_out: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&csiss_in>;
				clock-lanes = <0>;
				data-lanes = <1 2>;
			};
		};
	};
